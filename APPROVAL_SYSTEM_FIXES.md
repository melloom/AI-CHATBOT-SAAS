### 2. Company Access Issue
**Problem**: Users were getting sign-in errors or couldn't access their company after approval.

**Root Cause**:
- Authentication flow wasn't properly handling approval status
- Users weren't being redirected correctly based on approval status
- Missing proper error messages for different scenarios

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Improved login page with better error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Enhanced auth provider to properly handle approval status routing
- ✅ Added debugging logs to track user approval status

  - Identify orphaned companies (companies without users)
  - Fix orphaned users by creating missing companies
  - Approve all pending approvals at once
  - Refresh data to see real-time changes

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages in login process
- Console logging for debugging approval issues
- Improved validation in company creation process

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Company Approval
1. Have a friend sign up with a new account
2. Go to `/dashboard/admin/approvals` as an admin
3. You should now see the pending company approval
4. Approve the company
5. The user should be able to access their dashboard

### 2. Test Debug Page
1. Go to `/dashboard/admin/debug-approvals` as an admin
2. Check the statistics to see if there are any orphaned users/companies
3. Use the "Approve All Pending" button to approve all pending approvals
4. Use the "Fix User" buttons to fix any orphaned users

### 3. Test Login Flow
1. Try logging in with a pending user
2. Should be redirected to `/pending-approval` page
3. After approval, should be able to access dashboard
4. Check console logs for debugging information

## Console Logging

The following console logs have been added for debugging:

### Company Creation
```
Company created successfully: [company-id]
```

### User Profile Loading
```
User profile loaded: {
  uid: [user-id],
  email: [email],
  approvalStatus: [status],
  isAdmin: [boolean],
  companyName: [company-name]
}
```

### Admin Approval Process
```
Found pending companies: [count]
Successfully updated company [company-id] approval status to [status]
Updated user [user-id] approval status to [status]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If companies still don't show up in approval page:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Go to debug page to see if companies exist
3. Check if companies have `approvalStatus: 'pending'`
4. Verify admin permissions

### If users can't access dashboard after approval:
1. Check user's approval status in debug page
2. Verify both user and company are approved
3. Check console logs for routing issues
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### If sign-in errors occur:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify user exists in Firebase
3. Check if user has proper approval status
4. Use debug page to identify orphaned users

## Files Modified
