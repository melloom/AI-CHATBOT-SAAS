# Platform Switching Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a platform switching system that allows users with access to multiple platforms to toggle between different platform-specific navigation menus in the sidebar.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Platform-Specific Navigation Menus**
Each platform now has its own dedicated navigation menu:

#### ChatHub Platform
- Dashboard
- ChatHub (AI chatbots)
- Marketplace
- Analytics
- Team
- Billing
- Settings

#### WebVault Platform
- Dashboard
- WebVault (web development)
- Projects
- Services
- Billing
- Settings

#### Personal AI Platform
- Dashboard
- Personal AI
- My Assistants
- Create Assistant
- Templates
- Billing
- Settings

### 2. **Platform Switcher UI**
- Shows platform buttons at the top of the sidebar for multi-platform users
- Each platform has its own icon (Bot for ChatHub, Globe for WebVault, Brain for Personal AI)
- Active platform is highlighted
- Clicking a platform switches the navigation menu

### 3. **Dynamic Navigation Labels**
- Shows "CHATHUB Navigation", "WEBVAULT Navigation", or "PERSONAL AI Navigation" based on active platform
- Single platform users see just "Navigation"

## How It Works

### For Multi-Platform Users (like all-platforms account):
1. **Platform Switcher**: Shows at the top with buttons for each available platform
2. **Dynamic Navigation**: Menu items change based on selected platform
3. **Active Platform**: Highlighted and shows platform-specific navigation

### For Single Platform Users:
- Shows platform-specific navigation without switcher
- No platform switching needed

### For Admin Users:
- Shows admin navigation (unchanged)
- Platform switching only applies to regular business accounts

## Test Account

**All Platforms Account:**
- Email: `all-platforms@example.com`
- Password: `test123456`
- Platforms: ChatHub, WebVault, Personal AI

## Expected Behavior

1. **Login** with all-platforms account
2. **See Platform Switcher** at top of sidebar with 3 platform buttons
3. **Click Different Platforms** to switch navigation menus
4. **Navigation Label** changes to show active platform
5. **Menu Items** change to platform-specific options

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`
  - Added platform-specific menu items
  - Added platform switching state
  - Added platform switcher UI
  - Updated navigation logic

### Key Components:
- `platformMenuItems` - Platform-specific navigation menus
- `activePlatform` - Current selected platform state
- `availablePlatforms` - User's accessible platforms
- Platform switcher buttons with icons

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users can easily switch between platforms
2. **Platform-Specific Features**: Each platform shows relevant navigation
3. **Clear Organization**: Navigation is organized by platform
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add new platforms
