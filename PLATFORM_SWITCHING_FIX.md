# Platform Switching Fix

## Issue Description

Users experienced a confusing and buggy experience when:
1. Logged in as one platform (e.g., WebVault)
2. Closed the browser/page
3. Returned to the website
4. Clicked on a different platform (e.g., Personal AI)
5. Were auto-logged into the dashboard but saw a mismatch between their actual login and the initial render

## Root Cause

The `activePlatform` state in the sidebar was initialized to `'chathub'` by default and was not persisted across page reloads or browser sessions. When users returned to the site:

1. Firebase authentication persisted (user was still logged in)
2. But the `activePlatform` state reset to `'chathub'` (default)
3. This created a mismatch between the user's actual platform access and what was being displayed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **localStorage Persistence**
- Added localStorage to persist the `activePlatform` state
- Platform preference is saved when user switches platforms
- Platform preference is restored when user returns to the site

### 2. **Smart Platform Initialization**
- On page load, check localStorage for the last active platform
- If the stored platform is still available to the user, restore it
- If not available, fall back to the first available platform
- Clear platform preference when user signs out

### 3. **User-Specific Platform Preferences**
- Track the last user email to ensure platform preferences are user-specific
- Clear platform preferences when switching between different user accounts
- Prevent platform preferences from bleeding between different users

### 4. **Cleanup on Sign Out**
- Clear all platform-related localStorage items when user signs out
- Ensure fresh start for next login

## Code Changes

### `components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx`

1. **Enhanced Platform State Management**:
```typescript
// Platform switching state with localStorage persistence
const [activePlatform, setActivePlatform] = useState<string>('chathub')

// Set initial active platform based on available platforms and localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  if (availablePlatforms.length > 0) {
    // Try to get the last active platform from localStorage
    const lastActivePlatform = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? localStorage.getItem('activePlatform') : null
    
    // If we have a stored platform and it's still available, use it
    if (lastActivePlatform && availablePlatforms.includes(lastActivePlatform)) {
      setActivePlatform(lastActivePlatform)
      console.log(`Restored active platform from localStorage: ${lastActivePlatform}`)
    } else if (!availablePlatforms.includes(activePlatform)) {
      // If current active platform is not available, switch to first available
      const firstAvailable = availablePlatforms[0]
      setActivePlatform(firstAvailable)
      console.log(`Switched to first available platform: ${firstAvailable}`)
    }
  }
}, [availablePlatforms, activePlatform])
```

2. **Platform Change Handler**:
```typescript
// Persist active platform changes to localStorage
const handlePlatformChange = (platform: string) => {
  setActivePlatform(platform)
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    localStorage.setItem('activePlatform', platform)
    console.log(`Platform changed and persisted: ${platform}`)
  }
}
```

3. **User Change Detection**:
```typescript
// Clear localStorage when user changes (different account)
useEffect(() => {
  if (profile?.email) {
    const storedUser = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? localStorage.getItem('lastUserEmail') : null
    if (storedUser && storedUser !== profile.email) {
      // Different user, clear platform preference
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
        localStorage.removeItem('activePlatform')
        localStorage.setItem('lastUserEmail', profile.email)
        console.log('User changed, cleared platform preference')
      }
    } else if (!storedUser) {
      // First time, store current user
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
        localStorage.setItem('lastUserEmail', profile.email)
      }
    }
  }
}, [profile?.email])
```

4. **Enhanced Sign Out Handler**:
```typescript
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  try {
    // Clear platform preference from localStorage on sign out
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      localStorage.removeItem('activePlatform')
      localStorage.removeItem('lastUserEmail')
      console.log('Cleared platform preferences from localStorage on sign out')
    }
    await signOut()
    router.push("/")
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Sign out error:", error)
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Multi-Platform User Session Persistence
1. Login with `all-platforms@example.com` (has access to all platforms)
2. Switch to WebVault platform
3. Close browser/tab
4. Return to website
5. **Expected**: Should be logged in and see WebVault platform active
6. **Actual**: ✅ Now correctly shows WebVault platform

### Test Scenario 2: Platform Switching
1. Login with multi-platform account
2. Switch between platforms (ChatHub → WebVault → Personal AI)
3. Refresh page
4. **Expected**: Should maintain the last selected platform
5. **Actual**: ✅ Now correctly maintains platform selection

### Test Scenario 3: User Account Switching
1. Login with one account, switch to WebVault
2. Sign out
3. Login with different account
4. **Expected**: Should not see WebVault preference from previous user
5. **Actual**: ✅ Now correctly clears preferences between users

## Benefits

1. **Consistent User Experience**: Platform selection persists across sessions
2. **No More Confusion**: Users see the correct platform interface on return
3. **User-Specific Preferences**: Each user's platform preferences are isolated
4. **Clean State Management**: Proper cleanup on sign out and user changes
5. **Fallback Safety**: Always defaults to available platform if stored preference is invalid

## Browser Compatibility

- Uses `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks for SSR compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers that support localStorage
- Gracefully degrades if localStorage is not available
